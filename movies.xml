<!--
How do you think XML relates to HTML? 
    XML is stored data that can be used in HTML

What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?  
    Makes documents transportable across systems and applications. With the help of XML, you can exchange data quickly between different platforms.
    XML separates the data from HTML
    XML simplifies platform change process

What are some disadvantages? 
    XML requires a processing application
    The XML syntax is very similar to other alternative 'text-based' data transmission formats which is sometimes confusing
    No intrinsic data type support
    The XML syntax is redundant
    Does not allow the user to create his tags.
